Balanced Testing Strategy for a Solo Developer
===============================================

Overview:
---------
This strategy aims to provide robust testing coverage while minimizing the time spent on testing. It is designed for a solo developer who wants to ensure that features work reliably when pushing a new version without an exhaustive test suite.

1. Prioritize Unit Testing for Critical Logic
-----------------------------------------------
- **Focus on Services:**
  - Write robust unit tests for all key business logic functions.
  - Ensure calculations, data transformations, and error handling are covered.
  - Use mocks for external dependencies (e.g., databases, external APIs) to keep tests fast and isolated.

- **Minimal Controller Tests:**
  - Write a few basic tests to confirm that controllers correctly translate HTTP requests to service calls.
  - Focus on testing that the right parameters are passed and that the correct responses (status codes, error messages) are returned.

2. Supplement with Selective Integration Tests
-----------------------------------------------
- **Target Key Endpoints and Workflows:**
  - Identify critical user flows (e.g., authentication, data submission) and write integration tests for them.
  - Simulate full request cycles (controller → service → database/external dependencies) for these workflows.
  
- **Keep the Suite Lean:**
  - Focus integration tests on the most essential parts rather than attempting to cover every endpoint.
  - Ensure that the end-to-end functionality of critical features is verified.

3. Automate Testing in Your Workflow
-------------------------------------
- **Continuous Integration (CI):**
  - Set up a simple CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) to run your test suite on every push or pull request.
  - This ensures early detection of regressions and maintains code stability.

- **Fast Feedback Loop:**
  - Maintain a balance by keeping most tests as unit tests to ensure quick execution.
  - Use the fast feedback from these tests to continuously validate changes during development.

4. Pragmatic Approach to Test Coverage
----------------------------------------
- **Test What Matters:**
  - Focus your efforts on parts of the code that are complex or prone to errors.
  - Not every small utility function may need its own test if it’s trivial.

- **Use Mocks Where Appropriate:**
  - In unit tests, mock out external systems to isolate and test business logic.
  - This keeps tests focused and fast-running.

- **Accept Imperfect Coverage:**
  - Aim for a balance between robustness and efficiency rather than striving for 100% test coverage.
  - A well-chosen subset of unit and integration tests can provide sufficient confidence in the application’s functionality.

Summary:
--------
- **Robust Unit Tests:** Ensure the core business logic (services) is thoroughly tested.
- **Selective Controller Tests:** Verify that the request/response handling and routing are correct.
- **Targeted Integration Tests:** Validate critical endpoints and workflows end-to-end.
- **Automated CI Pipeline:** Run tests automatically to catch regressions early.
- **Pragmatic Coverage:** Focus on critical parts and use mocks to keep tests fast and maintainable.

This approach provides a balanced testing strategy, ensuring your features work reliably while minimizing the time required to write and maintain tests.
